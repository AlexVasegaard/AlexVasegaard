- 👋 Hi, I’m @AlexVasegaard
- 👀 I’m interested in operations research, decision making, preference structure, and putting it all together through math and code
- 🌱 I’m currently a postdoc at Aalborg University specializing in multi-criteria decision-making, evolutionary multi-objective optimization, setwise preference integration and general automation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on operation research and preference modelling methods as I am working on satelite scheduling, UAV routing planning for multiple purposes e.g. search and rescue, vaccine delivery, tornado assessment. 
- 📫 How to reach me on my work email aev@mp.aau.dk
